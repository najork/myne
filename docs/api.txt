API Endpoints
=============

Usage: /api/(call)


getGameList(School)
    return list<Game>

getTicketList(Game)
    return list<Ticket>

getTicketCount(Game)
    return int

getPriceList(Game) --or-- getPricingInfo(Game) -- return min/med/max (?)
    - If we get the entire price list, we have a bit more flexibility on how we display pricing info in-app (e.g. we can later decide we want to include a graph showing distribution of prices), at the cost of increased network usage

getInfo(UserID)
    return User

postTicket(Ticket)
    return boolean

setSold(Ticket)
    return boolean

getUserEmail(UserID)
    return string

buyTicket(Ticket)   // Replaces setSold and contactUser when in-app tx support added
    return boolean
